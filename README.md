Welcome to my profile!<br><br>
<ul>
<li>I’m a self-taught front-end developer, learning React.js, Bootstrap and Tailwind-CSS.<br>
<li>My journey started with curiosity about the web, which led me to freeCodeCamp and The Odin Project—and I’ve been learning ever since.<br>
<li>Right now, I’m diving deeper into specialising in JavaScript to expand my skills.<br>
<li>Down the line, I’m also curious to explore Python and Golang to see where they take me.<br><br>

Still learning, still building. 🚀
